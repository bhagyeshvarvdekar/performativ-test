## Main Page of the website

The main page displays a list of all the books in your library. Here's what you can do on the main page:

- View Books: Browse through the list of books and get an overview of their details, including the title, author, description, and category.

- Sort Books: Sort the books based on different criteria such as title, author, or category. You can choose to sort the books in ascending or descending order.

- Filter Books: Use the search functionality to filter the books based on specific keywords. The search query will match against the book's title, author, or category.

- Additional Information: When viewing a book, the application integrates with Wikipedia to provide additional information about the book. You can find a summary, related articles, and more details sourced from Wikipedia.

- Book Images: The application also retrieves book images from an external source and displays them alongside the book information. This enhances the visual experience and helps you identify the books quickly.

- Manage Books: Each book entry in the list provides options to edit or delete the book. Clicking on the "Edit" button allows you to update the book's information, while the "Delete" button removes the book from your library.

- Add New Book: At the top of the page, there is a button labeled "Add Book." Clicking on this button takes you to a form where you can enter the details of a new book and add it to your collection.

Feel free to explore the main page and make use of the sorting, filtering, and management features to organize and maintain your book library efficiently. Enjoy the integration with Wikipedia and the visual representation of book images!
